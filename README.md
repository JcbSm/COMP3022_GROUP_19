# Plan of Action
Q1)Buildings-data heading used to check which location would take priority-(A big bar chart with x-axis location,y-axis:building (impact))
For Q2)Show uncertainity in data by colour coding the intensity of the hit.0 to 10 range 0,3 and4 to 7,8-10
have variation in colour based on duration and impact

A graph for data points being impact values for a certain hour-standard deviation being calculated from that mean to each data point.

For Q3)Conditions changing over time-Scroll bar of time-so its easier for emergency responder to pause and check

19locations in dataset-refer to example 1-dpst 
Scroll bar to show how magnitude of earthquake changes based on time
